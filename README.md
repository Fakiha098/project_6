# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Description
This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
By analyzing various features such as age, gender, class, and others, the model
aims to predict whether a passenger would have survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building and training machine learning models
- Evaluating model performance
- Predicting survival on the Titanic

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
